# Image2Ascii

This project converts images to ASCII characters (like @#$!%^&*), allowing you to transform an image into a text-based representation.

## How to Use

1. Download the program and place an image file in the same directory as the program.
2. Supported formats: png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, gif.
3. Run the program, and it will convert the image into an ASCII representation and save it to `output.txt`.

### Example of Image Placement:
Place your image file (e.g., `image.png`) in the same directory as the executable. Here's how the image placement should look:

After running the program, it will generate a text-based image in `output.txt`:

The output text will look something like this:

＠＆＠＠　＃！＆！＆　＠＠ ＆　＃＠　＠＠＠ ＠＆＠＆＆＠


## Notes

- The program automatically resizes the image to fit within a 300px width for better size.

Enjoy transforming your images into ASCII art!
